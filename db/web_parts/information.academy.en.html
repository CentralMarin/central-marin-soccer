<h2><strong style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.52em;"><em>THE ACADEMY GOALS AND FOCUS</em></strong></h2>

<p>Our program will focus on technical (skill-based) training and free play.&nbsp; The emphasis will be on skill development, where kids learn through direct experience and hands-on play; players will learn best &ldquo;by doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Technical training, tactical decision-making, and positional play are just a few areas that will be taught by the highly knowledgeable staff. &nbsp;Emphasis is always placed on teaching the basic rules, techniques, and skills that are essential to improve one&#39;s soccer game.&nbsp; Elements emphasized include:&nbsp; 1 vs 1, passing, receiving, shielding, decision-making skills and ball mastery.&nbsp; But the key to all of this is to have fun!&nbsp;</p>
