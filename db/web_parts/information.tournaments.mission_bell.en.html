<p><img alt="Mission Bell Logo" src="/tournament/mission_bell_logo.jpg" style="float:left; margin:10px" />The Mission Bell Classic was inaugurated in 1997 in memory of Claire Ann O&#39;Neil, a well-respected member of the Marin Soccer Community. &nbsp;The 16th annual Mission Bell Tournament, will be&nbsp;held the second weekend in August; 10th and 11th. &nbsp;This year we will host&nbsp;up to 96 teams in age groups u-12, U-13, U14, U15/16 (combined) in Silver/Bronze/Division III levels. &nbsp;As an early season tournament, the Mission Bell is good pre-season preparation, a testing ground for newly formed teams, as well as those returning teams, who are playing at the highest level of competition. Games are played on both turf and well-manicured grass fields.</p>
