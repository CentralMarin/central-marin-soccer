<h2>Donate</h2><p>On Equal Footing is Central Marin’s financial aid program to assist players who can’t afford the cost of a competitive soccer program. Over the years Central Marin’s OEF has given over $200,000 in financial aid. This past year we gave 75 scholarships to approximately 15% of our players, for a total of over $30,000.</p>
