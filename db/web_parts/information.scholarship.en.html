<h1>Scholarship Program: "On Equal Footing"</h1><p>Central Marin Soccer Clubâ€™s intent is to not deny any player the opportunity to play due to the expense of our program. There may be team and individual fund raising efforts, which will vary by team and age group. In addition to team efforts, The Central Marin Club has a financial aid program for teams to support their players. Financial aid may be requested and there is a formal, yet user-friendly application process. Scholarships levels may vary depending on numbers of applications and need, but generally range from $300 to $500 and there typically may be 1 to 3 scholarship players per team.</p><h2>Goal of Program</h2><p>The goal of the On Equal Footing Program is to eliminate the financial barriers that keep talented kids from playing soccer at the Competitive/Select level. The Competitive program is a higher level program, which includes advanced training for the more athletic player and allows them to travel to play against a higher level of competition. Whereas players may play 12 games in a recreational soccer season, it is typical for Competitive teams to play 24-50 games. Due to additional costs incurred in travel, special training, tournament fees, uniforms and equipment, youths from lower income families have historically been unable to participate at this level. This program has attempted to eliminate that barrier for some players in hopes that the program can be expanded and others will follow the lead of the contributors to this program by supporting players in other ways.</p><p>Special focus is being given to kids from the Canal Area, many of who do not try out for the traveling Teams due to the higher costs. Even though we limit our fees to $1,500 for the highest level and $950 for the 2nd level, this makes the program inaccessible for many players in Central Marin. This focus is to help a known problem and in a small way attempt to bring our communities together with a common sport. The program not only facilitates these players to play at a higher level, but also helps integrate the communities and develops common bonds between families that would not normally interact. In addition, many teams do extensive traveling, some to other states and countries, which helps broaden their view of the world. The program is open to all kids aged 9-17 living in Central Marin. It is not focused on specific race or sex, but on helping kids progress in sports and in life.</p><p>Each team must provide a scholarship to one player on their team before they are eligible for the Club or the "On Equal Footing" scholarship.</p><h2>Brief History</h2><ul><li>Over $127,000 has been raised and distributed</li><li>More than 195 scholarships have been awarded</li><li>In 2000, a team sponsored by On Equal Footing and Rotary Club of San Rafael and Luxembourg, primarily encompassing players who reside in the Canal, traveled to Luxembourg to play soccer</li><li>Summer 2002: the Luxembourg team returned, to play soccer with our local teams.</li></ul><h2>Scholarship Qualification</h2><ul><li>Candidate must be age 9-17 on August 1, 2010</li><li>Candidate is currently a resident within the geography covered by the Central Marin Competitive Youth Soccer Club.
