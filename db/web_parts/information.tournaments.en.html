<h1><strong>Central Marin Soccer Club Tournaments</strong></h1>

<p>The Mission Bell Classic and Premier Challenge Tournaments, hosted by the Central Marin Soccer Club are well respected tournaments in Northern California. &nbsp;They are&nbsp;US Club Sanctioned Tournaments accepting both NorCal and CYSA registered teams.&nbsp; The Mission Bell Classic was begun in 1998 and and has included boys and girls teams, under 12 through under-16 age teams, while the Premiere Challenge began in 2009 and includes U-9 through U-11 age teams for boys and girls. &nbsp;They have always reflected strong organization, &nbsp;played on quality fields in beautiful settings, many with views of Mount Tamalpais, with traditionally good weather, and&nbsp;with well-trained referees,&nbsp;attracting &nbsp;high quality and balanced competition. &nbsp;As an early/mid August tournament it has also been a testing ground for newly formed teams, blending competition and fun! &nbsp;Located in San Rafael and surrounding communities both tournaments give families the opportunity to experience beautiful Marin County.</p>

<p>The tournaments are fundraisers for &quot;On Equal Footing&quot; the club&#39;s financial aid / scholarship program which supports the youth in our community, minimizing the financial barrier, so that any qualified player may participate in the Central Marin Soccer Club. All profits are directed back to the club&#39;s teams and players. &nbsp;</p>
