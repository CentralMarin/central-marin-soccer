There may be team and individual fund raising efforts, which will vary by team and age group. In addition to team efforts, The Central Marin Club has a financial aid program for teams to support their players. Financial aid may be requested and there is a formal, yet user-friendly application process. Scholarships levels may vary depending on numbers of applications and need, but generally range from $300 to $500 and there typically may be 1 to 3 scholarship players per team. <a data-cke-saved-href="/information/on-equal-footing" href="/information/on-equal-footing" style="line-height: 1.52em;">On Equal Footing Program...</a></p>
