Refs, please review and check back often during the first few weeks of the season.</p><p>Jewelry Policy: please see the&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="/referees/CYSA_Policy_on_Jewelry_2010.pdf" href="/referees/CYSA_Policy_on_Jewelry_2010.pdf" target="_blank">Jewelry Policy PDF&nbsp;</a>for clarification on enforcement of the jewelry policy (it's all about safety!!)</p><p>Two-man referee system&nbsp;will be used for many U9, U10 &amp; U11 games. Get up to date on how this system works!</p><p>Arrival:&nbsp;Please arrive 20 minutes prior to game time to begin player check-in procedures. Every attempt must be made to keep the games running on time as they are often scheduled back-to-back.</p><p>Dress:&nbsp;All referees should wear the official yellow and black striped shirt with certification patch attached, black shorts and socks. You should bring a set of side-line flags, and have a watch with timer, whistle, watch, coin, red &amp; yellow cards, and pen.</p><p>Referee Report: The home team is required to provide both a USClub roster, as well as a game card. Center refs should download and print of the&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="/referees/refereereport.pdf" href="/referees/refereereport.pdf">USClub referee report</a>, which can double as a game card should the home team fail to provide one.</p><h2>Two-man Referee System</h2><p>The two referees should be on opposite sides of the field, a few yards inside the touch line to start. The two referees should position themselves so that the play is between them and that they can see one another.</p><p>The referee to whom the play is coming is the "lead" referee, and the other is the "trail" referee. The lead referee is primarily responsible for the whistle, including offsides calls, and is the one who will control play on restarts after fouls, place kicks, substitutions, etc. Nevertheless, the trail referee is fully empowered to call the game as he / she sees fit and is not considered "junior" in any way. Neither should wait to the other to make a decision – it is better to both call the same foul than to let it go uncalled.</p><p>Remember, as play comes toward your half, you will be trying to be in a position to judge offsides, so you will be at or near the offsides line. However, you will be "cheating" off the offsides line to be in position to judge the play and call any fouls.</p><p>As play comes towards you (and you become "lead") - go wide. By the time play is in the penalty box, you should be positioned like an AR (but stay on the field! This just means you should be aligned on the offsides line). If the play is in your half of the field but on the opposite side, pinch in towards the middle. As play goes away from you, and you become the “trail” follow it and pinch in to the middle. If play is in the other half of the field but on your side near the corner flag, go into the other half to the about the 30 yard mark (do not go any deeper because you need to get back when play changes direction).</p><p>During set plays, the trail referee should be positioned close to where a center referee typically would be, with the lead referee positioned similar to where a "lead" AR would be (to view offsides). On corner kicks, the trail referee should stand just inside halfway line, the lead referee referee should stand near goal line, watching for the ball in play.</p><p>The two-man referee system will be used for U9, U10, and U11 games.</p><h2>Game Length</h2><table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" style="width:100%"><thead><tr><th scope="col"><p>Age</p></th><th scope="col"><p>Half Length</p></th><th scope="col"><p>Halftime</p></th><th scope="col"><p>Ball Size</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>U9</p></td><td><p>2 x 25 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>U10</p></td><td><p>2 x 25 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>U11</p></td><td><p>2 x 30 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>U12</p></td><td><p>2 x 35 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>U13</p></td><td><p>2 x 35 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>U14</p></td><td><p>2 x 35 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>U16</p></td><td><p>2 x 40 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>U19</p></td><td><p>2 x 45 minutes</p></td><td><p>10 minutes</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><br></h2><h2>Game Card Procedures</h2><p>For NorCal League and State Cup games, the home team manager provides and retains the completed game card.</p><h2>Send-Off Procedures</h2><p>Norcal Premier Rules&nbsp;(pdf). See pages 31-34 for Referee Information.</p><p>For NorCal games, the pass is returned immediately to the coach/manager.</p><h2>Rain Procedures</h2><p>Referees should check the&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="/fields" href="/fields">rain hotlines</a>&nbsp;in advance of their games in the event of rain, or contact the referee scheduler. Payment will not be made for rain-outs. Every effort will be made to schedule the same refs for the re-scheduled game. If weather conditions are such that a game cannot continue in the estimation of the Center Referee, play will be suspended. Lightening automatically suspends a game.</p><h2>Referee Registration</h2><p>You must update your registration annually or it will lapse. Training is not mandatory if you remain at the same grade (level).
