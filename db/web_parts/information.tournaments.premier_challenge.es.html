<p><img alt="Premier Challenge Logo" src="/assets/tournament/premier_challenge_logo.jpg" style="float:left; margin:10px" />The 5th annual Premier Challenge will be held August 17th and 18th. &nbsp;We will host up to 96 teams in age groups U9, U10 and U11; in Gold/Silver I and Silver II/Bronze level brackets. &nbsp;As an early season tournament its a good tournament for newly formed teams, testing their pre-season form, or returning teams whom are stepping up to gold level competition. &nbsp;Most games are played on well-maintained grass fields, good playing conditions for the warm summer months.&nbsp;</p>
