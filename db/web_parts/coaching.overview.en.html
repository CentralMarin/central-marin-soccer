<p>The development of the Central Marin Soccer Club is based from a mix of fundamental principles from clubs Barcalona, Ajax and the US National team curriculum:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Playing the game with the idea of playing attractive soccer.</li>
	<li>Teaching the player to have passion for the game</li>
	<li>The team is more important than any player (individuality)</li>
</ol>

<p>However, it is the coaches responsibility to develop the individual players technical, tactical and vision of the game.</p>

<p>The Central Marin Soccer Club includes all age groups: there are teams with 7 year old children up to the U19 age group. They are taken through the various stages of player development,encompassing individual athletic,technical,tactical and social development. It is important that the Central Marin players are treated equally with the same care and attention to all players (all levels) within the club.</p>

<p>The task of a coach is to create a team with individuality, taking into consideration the nature and particular characteristics of each player. The coach should always keep an eye on the group ambition.The coaches prepare the exercises for each age group that will shape children&rsquo;s skills and habits. Generally, coaches do not conduct any lessons which are uninteresting or unpleasant for the youth teams. A nine-year-old child must have fun and understand what he is doing when practicing with the coach. Definitely, the most important skill is the necessity of technique and development of the imagination of the young player. The player should be trained in such a way that he or she can imagine the best solution during the action and have the technique that allows success.</p>

<p>Every training session and match and every moment of the youth academy&rsquo;s activities should be characterized by enthusiasm and fun - all aspects which help create the ideal climate and environment in which the boys and girls can develop properly. In sum, in all age groups, individual and technical skills development are the key instructions and focus.</p>
