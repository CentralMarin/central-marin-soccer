<h2>Mission Bell</h2>

<p>The Mission Bell Classic was inaugurated in 1997 in memory of Claire Ann O&#39;Neil, a well-respected member of the Marin Soccer Community. &nbsp;The 16th annual Mission Bell Tournament, will be&nbsp;held the second weekend in August; 10th and 11th. &nbsp;This year we will host&nbsp;up to 96 teams in age groups u-12 through u-14 in Premier/Gold/SilverI and SilverII/Bronze bracket levels. &nbsp;As an early season tournament, the Mission Bell is good pre-season preparation, a testing ground for newly formed teams, as well as those returning teams, who are playing at the highest level of competition. Games are played on both turf and well-manicured grass fields.&nbsp;</p>
