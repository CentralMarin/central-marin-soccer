<h3>The Silver &amp; Bronze Division Programs for U10-U19 Boys and Girls</h3>

<h3>Scholarship Program: &quot;On Equal Footing&quot;</h3>

<p>​​</p>

<p>Central Marin Soccer Club&rsquo;s intent is to not deny any player the opportunity to play due to the expense of our program. There may be team and individual fund raising efforts, which will vary by team and age group. In addition to team efforts, The Central Marin Club has a financial aid program for teams to support their players. Financial aid may be requested and there is a formal, yet user-friendly application process. Scholarships levels may vary depending on numbers of applications and need, but generally range from $300 to $500 and there typically may be 1 to 3 scholarship players per team. <a href="/information/on-equal-footing">On Equal Footing Program...</a></p>
