      heading: 'Central Marin Soccer and Mill Valley Soccer Club Form U12 Premier Level Teams'
      body: 'The Central Marin Soccer Club (CMSC) and&nbsp;Mill Valley Soccer Club (MVSC) are pleased to announce that we will be partnering to implement a new soccer program for our U12 competitive soccer players. &nbsp;This program will be introduced as a PILOT program in 2015.&nbsp;
            <p>In 2015, CMSC&nbsp;and&nbsp;MVSC&nbsp;will collaborate to form Premier level teams for CMSC and MVSC’s U12&nbsp;players (born from Aug 1, 2003 to July 31, 2004).&nbsp;There will be one combined Premier level team for boys and one combined Premier level team for girls. &nbsp;The clubs will still form their own individual “A” (Gold/Silver) and “B” (Silver/Bronze) teams for U12 boys and girls.</p>

            <p>A primary goal of this collaboration is to provide an additional level of opportunity for both clubs’ players at an age group when the game moves to a larger field and when teams transition from playing 8 v 8 to 11 v 11 soccer.&nbsp; As roster sizes expand at U12, there is typically an increased disparity in the ability of the players within CM and MV&nbsp;teams. &nbsp;None of the players are served well in this scenario. &nbsp;The new program will provide all players in the cohort greater opportunity to train, play and compete in a more ability-appropriate environment.</p>

            <p>The combined Premier teams will be formed through an open tryout.&nbsp;Tryouts will take place on:*</p>

            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>2/22:&nbsp; Girls: 9-10:30 am.&nbsp; Boys: 10:30am-12pm.&nbsp; Tryouts at Tam HS turf.</li>
              <li>2/28:&nbsp; Boys:&nbsp; 9-11am.&nbsp; Girls: 11am-1pm.&nbsp; Tryouts at Tam HS turf.</li>
              <li>3/1:&nbsp; Boys and Girls:&nbsp; 5-6:30 pm.&nbsp; Tryouts at Marin Academy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>*Please check the club’s website several days before tryouts to confirm the tryout schedule.</em></p>

            <p>Tryouts for MVSC’s and CMSC’s independent A and B teams will be held after the Premier team tryouts.&nbsp; CMSC’s U12 A and B Team Tryouts will be held in late March / early April.</p>

            <p>The program will consist of an initial spring training season will that will run March – June (players will not be expected to quit other spring sports to be part of the Premier teams), with an additional fall/winter season from August through January/February.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This collaboration will be piloted in 2015 and will be evaluated at the end of the fall season. Player/parent feedback will be a key element of the evaluation. If the collaboration is found to be a success, it will continue for the following U13 season.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For more details about the Premier level teams, such as training locations and frequency, team coaches, team name, try-out registration, estimated cost, etc., see the FAQ below.</p>

            <p>MVSC and CMSC are confident this new program will enhance the playing experience and development of players in both clubs by&nbsp;providing a more skill-appropriate, ability-appropriate, and commitment-appropriate environment for all of our U12 competitive soccer players. &nbsp;We look forward to seeing your kids out on the field.</p>'
      faq_heading: 'CMSC/MVSC 2015 U12 Pilot FAQ'
      faq_body: '<p><strong>1.&nbsp;What will the CMSC/MVSC combined Premier teams be called?</strong></p>

                 <p>The team name for the Boys and Girls teams will be “United.” (MV United or CM United.)</p>

                 <p><strong>2.&nbsp;How many players will be on each United Team?</strong></p>

                 <p>United Team rosters will not exceed 18 players.&nbsp; Roster size decisions will be based upon the coaching staff’s assessment of the pool of qualified players.&nbsp; The primary objective will be to ensure that each player selected to a roster will be ability-appropriate for the team.</p>

                 <p><strong>3. Where will the United Teams train and play games?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

                 <p>Players who tryout for the United Premier level teams should be prepared to train and play at any location where CMSC and/or MVSC train or play.&nbsp;</p>

                 <p><strong>4.&nbsp;Will “quotas” be utilized in determining roster placements on United Teams?</strong></p>

                 <p>No.&nbsp; The most qualified players will be selected for these teams, regardless of which clubs they are from.</p>

                 <p><strong>5. &nbsp; Will “out of area” players (i.e., non-MV, non-CM) be permitted to play on United teams?</strong></p>

                 <p>Yes.&nbsp; CMSC and MVSC currently have open boundaries for their competitive teams at all ages.&nbsp; One important overall objective of both clubs is to place all ability- and commitment-appropriate CM and MV residents on ability-appropriate Competitive teams.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the formation of United teams and the inclusion of out-of-area players will result in the creation of more (and not fewer) ability-appropriate competitive opportunities for MV and CM residents.&nbsp; It’s acknowledged that not as many players from each community will be able to play for the highest level team.&nbsp; However, ALL of the competitive teams that are formed (Premier, Gold, Silver, Bronze) should become more (not less) ability-appropriate due to a) the expansion of the total player pool and b) improved collaboration between the clubs in providing playing opportunities for all ability-appropriate competitive players.&nbsp; To reiterate, the competitive teams formed will have less within-group variability in talent/commitment, and more players will be placed on teams that are appropriate for each individual’s level of play.</p>

                 <p><strong>6. &nbsp; What club does each United team register through?</strong></p>

                 <p>The U12 boys United team will be registered with Central Marin Soccer Club and the U12 girls United team will be registered with Mill Valley Soccer Club.&nbsp; Pre-registration for tryouts will be announced soon.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

                 <p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Who will coach the U12 United Teams?</strong></p>

                 <p>Phil Bilecci-Gard will coach the U12 United boys team. &nbsp;Rob Funes will coach the U12 United girls team.</p>

                 <p><strong>8. &nbsp; How many United Team tryouts does a player need to attend to be considered for a roster spot?</strong></p>

                 <p>Players are encouraged to attend all tryouts, and it is in each player’s best interest to attend as many tryouts as possible.&nbsp; However, a player needs to attend at least one tryout in order to be considered for a roster spot.</p>

                 <p><strong>9. &nbsp; What will the calendar look like for the United teams?</strong></p>

                 <ul>
                 	<li>Tryouts will take place on:*
                 	<ul>
                 		<li>2/22:&nbsp; Girls: 9-10:30 am.&nbsp; Boys: 10:30am-12pm.&nbsp; Tryouts at Tam HS turf.</li>
                 		<li>2/28:&nbsp; Boys:&nbsp; 9-11am.&nbsp; Girls: 11am-1pm.&nbsp; Tryouts at Tam HS turf.</li>
                 		<li>3/1:&nbsp; Boys and Girls:&nbsp; 5-6:30 pm.&nbsp; Tryouts at Marin Academy.</li>
                 	</ul>
                 	</li>
                 </ul>

                 <p style="margin-left:0.75in"><em>*Please check the clubs’ websites several days before tryouts to confirm schedule.</em></p>

                 <ul>
                 	<li>Families will be notified no later than 3/3.</li>
                 	<li>Final rosters will be posted no later than 3/5.</li>
                 	<li>A Parent Registration and Information meeting will be held at on Wednesday, March 11 at 7:30pm at a location TBD.&nbsp; More information about this meeting will be provided soon.</li>
                 	<li>United teams will begin training in mid-March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                 	<li>The teams will train 3 x/week: two weekdays and one weekend day (the weekend session may be a training or a friendly game). &nbsp;Players will be encouraged to attend all three weekly sessions<em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>However, United players will be required to commit to attending a minimum of one session per week on average during the spring.</strong></em></li>
                 	<li>United Teams will take a break for at least 1.5 months during the summer. &nbsp;Fall and Winter calendars will be the similar to those of the current U12 CMSC and MVSC Teams.&nbsp; The mandatory start date for the fall season training will be Monday, August 3.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <p>​<strong>10. Will United Team players be required to quit other sports?</strong></p>

                 <p>No.&nbsp; Participation in other sports is fully supported by the new program, provided that the players meet the mandated commitment.&nbsp; As noted above, the spring commitment requirement is such that players attend a minimum of one weekly session on average.&nbsp; During the fall and winter, players will be expected to attend all team events.</p>

                 <p><strong>11.&nbsp; What are the costs to participate on a United Team?</strong></p>

                 <p>The cost will be roughly $2,200 - $2,500.&nbsp; This cost covers both Spring and Fall/Winter play and includes registration and uniform purchase.</p>

                 <p><strong>12.&nbsp; What is the policy on Financial Aid for players on United Teams?</strong></p>

                 <p>Partial, need-based financial aid will be available.&nbsp; Families requesting financial aid will be required to submit a financial aid application at the Parent Registration event.&nbsp; A scholarship committee will review the applications and determine awards.</p>

                 <p><strong>13.&nbsp; What will be the anticipated impact of the formation of United Teams on the CMSC and MVSC competitive player pools?</strong></p>

                 <p>Each club’s independent “A” and “B” teams will end up with a roster composition of more ability-appropriate and commitment-appropriate players.</p>

                 <p>In some cases, the formation of MU teams could facilitate the formation of “C” teams (teams that otherwise would not have formed) in one or more parent clubs*.</p>

                 <p><em>*It should be noted that historically CMSC and MVSC</em>&nbsp;<em>have had difficulty creating playing opportunities for<strong>&nbsp;<u>all</u></strong>&nbsp;ability-appropriate U12 competitive players.&nbsp; Turnouts at CM and MV tryouts have often been such that insufficient team roster spots were available for every qualified player, or there were not enough ability-appropriate players to form a complete U12 team.&nbsp; Collaboration between the two clubs will ensure a&nbsp;<u>larger total pool of players</u>, which will result in&nbsp;</em>more<em>&nbsp;competitive playing opportunities than those created by the status quo model in which the clubs form all teams independently.</em></p>

                 <p><strong>14.&nbsp; Will players from one club be permitted to play for another club’s “A” or “B” team at U12?</strong></p>

                 <p>Yes.&nbsp; However, this will be discouraged in general.</p>

                 <p><strong>&nbsp;15. Can players born on or after August 1, 2004 earn roster spots on United teams?</strong></p>

                 <p>U11 players are welcome to tryout, but they will only be offered roster spots if they are viewed by the professional coaching staff as being among the top 5 players on the U12 Premier team, or with approval from the two clubs’ Directors of Coaching.</p>

                 <p><strong>16</strong>. &nbsp;<strong>If one or both clubs were to have less than a full team of ability-appropriate competitive players attending their club’s team tryouts, will the clubs work together to create playing opportunities for these players?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

                 <p>Yes.&nbsp; Any of the following actions could be taken:</p>

                 <ul>
                 	<li>The “extra” ability-appropriate players from one club could be invited to tryout for the neighboring club’s “A”, “B” or “C” team.</li>
                 	<li>The “extra” ability-appropriate players from both clubs could be invited to join together and tryout for a “C” team composed of players from the two clubs.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <p><strong>17.&nbsp; Who will oversee the soccer programmatic aspects of the United Teams?</strong></p>

                 <p>Coach hiring and “on-field” Soccer program oversight will be managed collaboratively by CMSC and MVSC’s Directors of Coaching, with high-level governance oversight by Competitive Leaderships of both clubs.</p>

                 <p><strong>18. What Uniforms will the United teams wear?</strong></p>

                 <p>The MV United team will wear the MVSC uniform and the CM United team will wear the CM uniform. &nbsp;Both uniforms will have a “United” call-out added to the graphics.</p>

                 <p><strong>19. If a player does not want to play in spring, can they still try-out and join the team in the fall?</strong></p>

                 <p>No. One important objective of forming United teams is to provide a developmental opportunity for the ability-appropriate&nbsp;<em>and committed</em>&nbsp;soccer player. United players will be&nbsp;<em>encouraged&nbsp;</em>to attend all sessions, and they will be&nbsp;<em>required</em>&nbsp;to attend a minimum of one weekly event on average during the spring season.</p>

                 <p><strong>20. In what level of competition will the United teams compete?</strong></p>

                 <p>Our primary aim will be to place each United team in ability-appropriate leagues and competitions.&nbsp; It is anticipated that United teams will compete at the Premier level, but this decision will be made with the interests of the players and team at a premium.&nbsp; As such, final decisions on level of play will be based on the Professional Coaching Staff’s assessment of the player pool after team formation.</p>

                 <p><strong>21.&nbsp;When will tryouts be&nbsp;held for Central Marin''s other U12 Competitive Teams?</strong></p>

                 <p>Central Marin’s other U12 Arsenal and Magic tryouts will be held in early March, anticipated March 7/8 and 15/16, consistent with our previous years'' tryout schedule. &nbsp;The official tryout schedule will be posted to Central Marins website by early February.</p>

                 <p><strong>22.&nbsp; What is the Pilot Program’s relationship to Marin FC?</strong></p>

                 <p>The Pilot Program will be assessed and reviewed by Central Marin and Mill Valley, with consultation from Marin FC and with consideration of a possible collaboration with Marin FC for the following year.</p>
